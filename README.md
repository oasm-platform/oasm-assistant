# OASM ASSISTANT

**Support in Managing, Monitoring, and Preventing Attack Surfaces**

Built by: **Team OASM-Platform**

---

## Overview

OASM Assistant is an AI-powered layer built on top of the OASM-Platform (Open-ASM) that provides intelligent automation and optimization for external attack surface management. The system leverages multi-agent architecture with LangGraph to deliver comprehensive threat intelligence, vulnerability analysis, and incident response capabilities.

## OASM Ecosystem

### Open-ASM (Core Platform)

The foundation platform for External Attack Surface Management featuring:

- **Microservices architecture** for scalability and flexibility
- **Discovery tools**: Subfinder, Dnsx, Naabu, Httpx
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Nuclei, Nessus
- **Asset management** and job scheduling
- **RESTful APIs** and **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** support
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** integration

### OASM-ASSISTANT (AI Layer)

The intelligent layer on top of the core platform providing:

- **AI-powered automation** of security workflows
- **Multi-agent system** built with LangGraph
- **Intelligent orchestration** and decision-making
- **Real-time threat analysis** and response

## System Architecture

The OASM ecosystem consists of three main layers:

### 1. OASM ASSISTANT (AI Layer)

Intelligent agents that provide advanced security capabilities:

- **Domain Classifier Agent**
- **Threat Intelligence Agent**
- **Analysis Agent**
- **Incident Responder Agent**
- **Orchestration Agent**

Connected to OASM Core via **gRPC APIs**

### 2. OASM CORE (Central Block)

Central management and coordination:

- Asset Management
- Job Scheduling and Management
- Forward to OASM Assistant
- API Gateway
- MCP Integration
- Data Storage & Caching

Provides **RESTful APIs** and **SSE** for real-time updates

### 3. OASM WORKERS (Tools Execution Layer)

Execute security tools and return results to OASM Core:

- **Discovery**: Subfinder, dnsx, naabu, httpx
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Nuclei, Nessus

## AI Agents

### Domain Classifier

Automatically classifies digital assets by analyzing HTML content:

- Assigns labels based on title and content
- Identifies high-value targets
- Helps prioritize asset management and monitoring
- Detects assets likely to be targeted by attackers

### Threat Intelligence Agent

Provides proactive threat monitoring:

- **Threat monitoring**: Continuous surveillance of attack surface
- **Intelligence analysis**: IOC (Indicator of Compromise) correlation
- **Exploring enemy weapons research**: Understanding attacker tools and techniques
- **Attack prediction**: Anticipating potential threats
- **Threat alerts**: Real-time notifications of security risks

### Analysis Agent

Comprehensive vulnerability assessment and reporting:

- **Collect results** from OASM Core
- **Compare security status** with international standards (OWASP, CWE, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001)
- **Prioritize vulnerabilities** by context and business impact
- **Prepare detailed reports** with remediation plans

### Incident Responder Agent

Automated incident response and investigation:

- **Detect attacks** in progress
- **Attack method analysis**: Understanding attacker techniques
- **Generate incident response plans**: Step-by-step remediation
- **Automatically prevent vulnerabilities**: Proactive security measures
- **Investigate the entire incident**: Complete forensic analysis

### Orchestrator Agent

Central coordination and user interaction:

- **Understanding user intent**: Natural language processing
- **Agent coordination**: Managing workflows across specialized agents
- **Summary of results**: Consolidated reporting
- **Manage conversations**: Interactive dialogue with users

## Technology Stack

### AI & Machine Learning

- **LangGraph**: Building LLM-powered agents with tools
- **LLMs**: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, Olama...
- **Transfer Learning & Reinforcement Learning**: Continuous improvement

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

Built with **LlamaIndex** framework for advanced document retrieval:

- **Hybrid Search Strategy**:
  - **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: Vector similarity search for semantic matching
  - **BM25**: Keyword-based full-text search for precise term matching
  - Combined ranking for optimal retrieval accuracy
- **Re-ranking**: Optimized result ordering using relevance scoring
- **Embedding Generation**: Batch processing for efficient vector creation
- Enhanced data sources:
  - Memory agent (conversation history and context)
  - Knowledge base (security standards, best practices)
  - Nuclei template library (vulnerability patterns)

### Communication & Integration

- **gRPC**: High-performance RPC between AI layer and Core platform
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Provide real-time asset context to AI agents
- **SearXNG**: Privacy-respecting metasearch engine integration

### Data Storage & Processing

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database storage
- **Batch processing**: Efficient embedding generation
- **Content extraction**: PDF, DOCX, YAML, and more
- **Parallel vector search**: Fast similarity queries
- **pgvector extension**: Vector similarity search in PostgreSQL
